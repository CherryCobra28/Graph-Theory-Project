    \section{Introduction}
    This project seeks to investigate the structural difference between random graphs and small-world, scale-free graphs and in particular Albert-Barabási graphs. Then these properties will be tested by how the affect an SIRD model ran on both types of graph. The motivation for this project was from a deep interest in graph theory and with the recent COVID-19 pandemic how the way human relations may affect the spread of infectious disease.
    


    \section{Literature Review}
        \subsection{Graph Theory}
        Graph Theory is the study of networks where vertices are connected by edges, see APPENDIX for a further explanation.
        \subsection{Small World Graphs}
        In May 1967 Professor of Psychology at the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York, Stanley Milgram ran an experiment to see if a person living
        in Omaha, Nebraska could get a parcel to a stockbroker in Boston, Massachusetts \parencite{milgram1967small}. In his experiment he found the average path length to reach the stockbroker was 5.5, which created the term
        six degrees of separation (however Milgram's experiment had flaws which puts the exact number into doubt). This idea of having such a small average path length for such numerous nodes is a hallmark of a small world graph.\\
        A Small world graph is formally defined by the following property: $L\propto\log{N}$ where $L$ is the average shortest path length of the network and $N$ is the total number of nodes \parencite{Watts1998}. Several models exist to generate small world graphs such as the Watts-Strogatz Model.

        \subsection{Scale Free Graphs}
        In networks that appear in the real world such as the internet and social groups, there exists nodes known as "hubs" (a node that has a higher degree then the average of the graph). This is an important property encapsulated in Scale-Free Graphs.\\ 
        Scale-free Graphs are formally defined by the following power law: $P(k) \sim  k^{-\gamma }$, $k$ is the degree of a vertex, $P(k)$ is the probability of a node having degree $k$ and $\gamma$ is a parameter determined by the graph typically $2<\gamma<3$ \parencite{onnela2007structure}.

        \subsection{Barabasi-Albert Model}
        In 1999, Albert-László Barabási and Réka Albert developed the Albert-Barabási Model which generates small world, scale free graphs by a process of preferential attachment \parencite{barabasi1999emergence}. The model works as such:define two parameters $n$ (The number nodes the graph at the end of the process will have) and $e$ (the number of edges added for each new node) take a seed graph, add one new node to the graph, using preferential attachment add $e$ edges from the new node to nodes on the seed graph, continue till there are $n$ nodes on the graph.\\
        Preferential attachment describes a 'rich get richer effect' that is the higher the degree of the node the more likely it will gain a new edge, the following formula describes it $\prod (k_{i}) = \frac{k_{i}}{\sum_{j} {k_{j}}}$ where $k_{i}$ is the degree of node $i$. 
        \subsection{SIRD Model}
        SIRD stands for Susceptible, Infected, Recovered and Dead which is the states each individual in the model can take
    \section{Mathematical Methods}
        \subsection{Networkx}
        To begin we should explain the software that this project is based most heavily on. Networkx is a module for the Python programming language that allows for the creation and manipulation of graphs \parencite{SciPyProceedings_11}.
